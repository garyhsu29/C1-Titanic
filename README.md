# C1-Titanic
From Kaggle
### Please Open C1-model.ipynb for details
File:  
1. train.csv, training data with label survive  
2. test.csv, testing data without label  
3. res.csv first attemp, without feature engineering  
4. res_after_feature_engineering.csv final result with feature engineering  

Using NLP skill to preprocess the data, and get more accuracy predict with each model (Decision Tree, SVC, Logistic Regression, GradientBoosting, MLP)
